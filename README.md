# Welcome to Peak api 🌲
This is an open source project focusing on gpx data visualization with a community aspect. 
I wish to build an a web app like Komoot and Strava.

## Learning by doing
I'm currently learning Rust and this project allow me to practice. 
This repo might be deleted later since i'm still working on the architecture of this project and choosing a stack. 
I have started doing schemas, such as database schemas for Postgres. I will not jump into code until i finished my "pre-prod" phase.

### I wish to learn
This project is an opportunity for me to learn new things. First, i want to learn Rust to avoid being stuck in the classic React/Node/TS stack. 
Secondly, i want to learn more about DevOps and tools like Traefik and HaProxy. 
And lastly, i want to try Angular for the frontend.
